## Getting Started
1. Click the `Code` button above and select `Download ZIP`
2. Open the run application on your computer.
    * Just press the windows key then type `run`. It should be the first app that comes up.
3. Type `%appdata%\.minecraft` into it and press enter.
    * This will open up your file explorer to you installation directory for Minecraft.
4. If you don't have a folder named `mods` in that directory, create one spelled exactly like that.
5. Move the `.zip` file you downloaded into the `mods` directory.
6. Unzip the file.
    * Make sure all the `.jar` files are in the `mods` folder. They cannot be in a subdirectory.
7. Restart Minecraft.
